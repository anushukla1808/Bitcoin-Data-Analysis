## **Analysis Overview**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Aggregated raw minute-level data into daily summaries.
   - Addressed missing values and placeholder timestamps.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Developed technical indicators to identify trends and reversal points:
     - **Moving Averages**: 7-day, 30-day, 10-day, and 50-day.
     - **Momentum**: Speed of price changes over 10 days.
     - **RSI**: Overbought (RSI > 70) and oversold (RSI < 30) conditions.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Examined daily price trends and monthly returns.
   - Analyzed Bitcoinâ€™s price volatility using daily returns.
   - Visualized correlations and key trading patterns.

4. **Advanced Insights**:
   - Correlation between price, volume, and technical indicators.
   - Identification of significant price drops (>5%).
   - Insights into clustered extreme price changes during major events.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Volatility**:
   - Bitcoin exhibits significant daily price fluctuations, making it a high-risk, high-reward asset.
2. **Market Cycles**:
   - Alternating periods of rapid growth and corrections highlight speculative booms and busts.
3. **Predictive Indicators**:
   - Moving averages and RSI are effective tools for trend identification and potential buy/sell signals.
4. **Volume and Price Relationship**:
   - Moderate correlation between trading volume and price suggests additional external factors (e.g., sentiment, news) influence price movements.
